                        Every issuance and trade of currency is recorded sequentially allowing for easy audits and eliminating
                        fraudulent token generation and transfers.

                        Provenance is the ability to track ownership of an asset. Imagine if you could track where every IGC token
                        you owned came from, who possess it before you, and what they spent it on. Not only is this a cool feature,
                        it can be used as a game mechanic.

                        Suppose each item in the game is tied to an IGC token, then the value of the item could vary depending on the
                        rank or prestige of the players who used it before you. Again, this could be implemented using a database and
                        traditional in-house IGC, but it would be complicated to implement while provenance comes naturally by design with blockchain.

                        A player should not have to trust that a resource or IGC is valuable (or more valuable than another resource). IGCs
                        from GameChain are public so players know exactly how many units there are in existence, whether there will ever be
                        more, or how often new units are created. This knowledge of the true scarcity of something intrinsically adds value to it.
